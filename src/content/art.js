  intro: "<p>I am the son of a woodworker. I grew up in the wood shop and woke up to the sounds of routers squealing. Watching my dad create art from hunks of wood was fascinating. It set me up to approach all of my work from an artistic angle.</p><p>These days I merge that very physical craft with my digital one. I build installation art that is both digital and analog. My father and I also run a woodworking studio. View our furniture designs at <a class='hoverable hoverable-light' href='http://hsquest.com' target='_blank'>H.S. Quest</a>.</p>",
